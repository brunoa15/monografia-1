-## Why Use This?
-
-**If you’re getting started** with React, use `create-react-app` to automate the build of your app. There is no configuration file, and `react-scripts` is the only extra build dependency in your `package.json`. Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern React app:
-
-* React, JSX, and ES6 support.
-* Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
-* A dev server that lints for common errors.
-* Import CSS and image files directly from JavaScript.
-* Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit` or other prefixes.
-* A `build` script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with sourcemaps.
-
-**The feature set is intentionally limited**. It doesn’t support advanced features such as server rendering or CSS modules. Currently, it doesn’t support testing either. The tool is also **non-configurable** because it is hard to provide a cohesive experience and easy updates across a set of tools when the user can tweak anything.
-
-**If you’re a power user** and are comfortable with configuring build dependencies yourself, you can use this tool as a boilerplate generator. When you “eject” from it, the tool moves all the configuration right into your project, and removes itself from the dependencies. This way you can customize everything in this setup but you won’t get the upstream updates of the curated set of plugins.
-
-**You don’t have to use this.** Historically it has been easy to [gradually adopt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BF58ZJ1ZQxY) React. However many people create new single-page React apps from scratch every day. We’ve heard [loud](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4) and [clear](https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/708675139253174273) that this process can be error-prone and tedious, especially if this is your first JavaScript build stack.

-## Limitations
-
-Our goal is to provide a tool that bootstraps a minimal production-ready React project with a great developer experience and sane defaults.
-
-This is why many features such as server rendering, experimental Babel plugins, or custom ESLint configuration, are not supported. It is hard to add features that would work for everyone without adding configuration. Having no configuration is an explicit design decision of this project. Currently, even running tests is not supported, although this limitation is temporary.
-
-If you want an advanced feature, you can still use this tool, and later run `npm run eject` (but then there’s no going back!)

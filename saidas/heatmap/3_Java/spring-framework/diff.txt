-## Spring Framework
-The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration
-model for modern Java-based enterprise applications -- on any kind of deployment
-platform. A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application
-level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams
-can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to
-specific deployment environments.
-
-The framework also serves as the foundation for [Spring Integration][], [Spring Batch][]

+The Spring Framework uses a [Gradle](http://gradle.org)-based build system. In the instructions
+below, [`./gradlew`](http://vimeo.com/34436402) is invoked from the root of the source tree and
+serves as a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build. The only
+prerequisites are [git](http://help.github.com/set-up-git-redirect) and JDK 1.6+.

+### check out sources
+`git clone git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework.git`
+
+### compile and test, build all jars, distribution zips and docs
+`./gradlew build`
+
+### install all spring-\* jars into your local Maven cache
+`./gradlew install`

+### import sources into your IDE
+Run `./import-into-eclipse.sh` or read `import-into-idea.md` as appropriate.

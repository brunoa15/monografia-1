-    This is called the [Block Exchange Protocol][1].
+Syncthing is a **continous file synchronization program**. It synchronizes
+files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.

+1. Safe From Data Loss
+
+   Protecting the user's data is paramount. We take every reasonable
+   precaution to avoid corrupting the user's files.
+
+2. Secure Against Attackers
+
+   Again, protecting the user's data is paramount. Regardless of our other
+   goals we must never allow the user's data to be susceptible to
+   eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.
+
+3. Easy to Use
+
+   Syncthing should be approachable, understandable and inclusive.
+
+4. Automatic
+
+   User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.
+
+5. Universally Available
+
+   Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
+   latest technology is not always available to any given individual.
+
+6. For Individuals
+
+   Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
+   secure and easy to use file synchronization.
+
+7. Everything Else
+
+   There are many things we care about that don't make it on to the list. It
+   is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict

-The following features are _not yet implemented but planned_:
-
- * Change detection by listening to file system notifications instead of
-   periodic scanning.
-
-The following features are _not implemented but may be implemented_ in
-the future:
-
- * Syncing multiple directories from the same syncthing instance.
-
- * Automatic NAT handling via UPNP.
-
- * Conflict resolution. Currently whichever file has the newest
-   modification time "wins". The correct behavior in the face of
-   conflicts is open for discussion.

-Security
---------
-
-Security is one of the primary project goals. This means that it should
-not be possible for an attacker to join a cluster uninvited, and it
-should not be possible to extract private information from intercepted
-traffic. Currently this is implemented as follows.
-
-All traffic is protected by TLS. To prevent uninvited nodes from joining
-a cluster, the certificate fingerprint of each node is compared to a
-preset list of acceptable nodes at connection establishment. The
-fingerprint is computed as the SHA-1 hash of the certificate and
-displayed in BASE32 encoding to form a compact yet convenient string.
-Currently SHA-1 is deemed secure against preimage attacks.
-
-Incoming requests for file data are verified to the extent that the
-requested file name must exist in the local index and the global model.
-
-Installing
-==========
-
-Download the appropriate precompiled binary from the
-[releases](https://github.com/calmh/syncthing/releases) page. Untar and
-put the `syncthing` binary somewhere convenient in your `$PATH`.
-
-If you are a developer and have Go 1.2 installed you can also install
-the latest version from source. `go get` works as expected but builds
-a binary without GUI capabilities. Use the included `build.sh` script
-without parameters to build a syncthing with GUI.
-
-Usage
-=====
-
-Check out the options:
-
-```
-$ syncthing --help
-Usage:
-  syncthing [options]
-
-...
-```
-
-Run syncthing to let it create it's config directory and certificate:
-
-```
-$ syncthing
-11:34:13 main.go:85: INFO: Version v0.1-40-gbb0fd87

-11:34:13 main.go:90: FATAL: No config file
-```
-
-Take note of the "My ID: ..." line. Perform the same operation on
-another computer to create another node. Take note of that ID as well,
-and create a config file `~/.syncthing/syncthing.ini` looking something
-like this:
-
-```
-[repository]
-dir = /Users/jb/Synced
-
-[nodes]
-NCTBZAAHXR6ZZP3D7SL3DLYFFQERMW4Q = 172.16.32.1:22000 192.23.34.56:22000
-CUGAE43Y5N64CRJU26YFH6MTWPSBLSUL = dynamic
-```
-
-This assumes that the first node is reachable on either of the two
-addresses listed (perhaps one internal and one port-forwarded external)
-and that the other node is not normally reachable from the outside. Save
-this config file, identically, to both nodes.
-
-If the nodes are running on the same network, or reachable on port 22000
-from the outside world, you can set all addresses to "dynamic" and they
-will find each other using automatic discovery. (This discovery,
-including port numbers, can be tweaked or disabled using command line
-options.)
-
-Start syncthing on both nodes. For the cautious, one side can be set to
-be read only.
-
-```

-GUI
----
-
-The web based GUI is disabled per default. To enable and access it you
-must start syncthing with the `--gui` command line option, giving a
-listen address. For example:
-
-```
-$ syncthing --gui 127.0.0.1:8080
-```
-
-You then point your browser to the given address.
-
-Excluding Files
----------------
-
-syncthing looks for files named `.stignore` while walking the
-repository. The file is expected to contain glob patterns of file names
-to ignore. Patterns are matched on file name only and apply to files in
-the same directory as the `.stignore` file and in directories lower down
-in the hierarchy.

-## Introduction
-
-Kubernetes is an open source system for managing [containerized applications](http://kubernetes.io/docs/whatisk8s/) across multiple hosts,
-providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications. Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF](https://www.cncf.io)).
-
-Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

-## Concepts Overview
-
-Kubernetes works with the following concepts:
-
-[**Cluster**](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/)
-: A cluster is a set of physical or virtual machines and other infrastructure resources used by Kubernetes to run your applications.
-
-[**Node**](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/node/)
-: A node is a physical or virtual machine running Kubernetes, onto which pods can be scheduled.
-
-[**Pod**](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/)
-: Pods are a colocated group of application containers with shared volumes. They're the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed with Kubernetes. Pods can be created individually, but it's recommended that you use a replication controller even if creating a single pod.
-
-[**Replication controller**](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/replication-controller/)
-: Replication controllers manage the lifecycle of pods. They ensure that a specified number of pods are running

+## Concepts
+
+Kubernetes works with the following concepts:
+
+**Clusters** are the compute resources on top of which your containers are built. Kubernetes can run anywhere! See the [Getting Started Guides](docs/getting-started-guides) for instructions for a variety of services.
+
+**Pods** are a colocated group of Docker containers with shared volumes. They're the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed with Kubernetes. Pods can be created individually, but it's recommended that you use a replication controller even if creating a single pod. [More about pods](docs/pods.md).
+
+**Replication controllers** manage the lifecycle of pods. They ensure that a specified number of pods are running
+at any given time, by creating or killing pods as required. [More about replication controllers](docs/replication-controller.md).
+
+**Services** provide a single, stable name and address for a set of pods.
+They act as basic load balancers. [More about services](docs/services.md).
+
+**Labels** are used to organize and select groups of objects based on key:value pairs. [More about labels](docs/labels.md).

-## Development
-
-### Go development environment
-
-Kubernetes is written in [Go](http://golang.org) programming language. If you haven't set up Go development environment, please follow [this instruction](http://golang.org/doc/code.html) to install go tool and set up GOPATH. Ensure your version of Go is at least 1.3.
-
-### Put kubernetes into GOPATH
-
-We highly recommend to put kubernetes' code into your GOPATH. For example, the following commands will download kubernetes' code under the current user's GOPATH (Assuming there's only one directory in GOPATH.):
-
-```
-$ echo $GOPATH
-/home/user/goproj
-$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/
-$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/
-$ git clone git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes.git
-```
-
-The commands above will not work if there are more than one directory in ``$GOPATH``.
-
-(Obviously, clone your own fork of Kubernetes if you plan to do development.)
-
-### godep and dependency management
-
-Kubernetes uses [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) to manage dependencies. It is not strictly required for building Kubernetes but it is required when managing dependencies under the Godeps/ tree, and is required by a number of the build and test scripts. Please make sure that ``godep`` is installed and in your ``$PATH``.
-
-#### Installing godep
-There are many ways to build and host go binaries. Here is an easy way to get utilities like ```godep``` installed:
-
-1. Ensure that [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Download) is installed on your system. (some of godep's dependencies use the mercurial
-source control system).  Use ```apt-get install mercurial``` or ```yum install mercurial``` on Linux, or [brew.sh](http://brew.sh) on OS X, or download
-directly from mercurial.
-2. Create a new GOPATH for your tools and install godep:
-```
-export GOPATH=$HOME/go-tools
-mkdir -p $GOPATH
-go get github.com/tools/godep
-```
-
-3. Add $GOPATH/bin to your path. Typically you'd add this to your ~/.profile:
-```
-export GOPATH=$HOME/go-tools
-export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
-```
-
-#### Using godep
-Here is a quick summary of `godep`.  `godep` helps manage third party dependencies by copying known versions into Godeps/_workspace.  You can use `godep` in three ways:
-
-1. Use `godep` to call your `go` commands.  For example: `godep go test ./...`
-2. Use `godep` to modify your `$GOPATH` so that other tools know where to find the dependencies.  Specifically: `export GOPATH=$GOPATH:$(godep path)`
-3. Use `godep` to copy the saved versions of packages into your `$GOPATH`.  This is done with `godep restore`.
-
-We recommend using options #1 or #2.
-
-### Hooks
-
-Before committing any changes, please link/copy these hooks into your .git
-directory. This will keep you from accidentally committing non-gofmt'd go code.
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-ln -s hooks/prepare-commit-msg .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
-ln -s hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg
-```
-
-### Unit tests
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-hack/test-go.sh
-```
-
-Alternatively, you could also run:
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-godep go test ./...
-```
-
-If you only want to run unit tests in one package, you could run ``godep go test`` under the package directory. For example, the following commands will run all unit tests in package kubelet:
-
-```
-$ cd kubernetes # step into kubernetes' directory.
-$ cd pkg/kubelet
-$ godep go test
-# some output from unit tests
-PASS
-ok      github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/pkg/kubelet   0.317s
-```
-
-### Coverage
-```
-cd kubernetes
-godep go tool cover -html=target/c.out
-```
-
-### Integration tests
-
-You need an etcd somewhere in your PATH. To install etcd, run:
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-hack/install-etcd.sh
-sudo ln -s $(pwd)/third_party/etcd/bin/etcd /usr/bin/etcd
-```
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-hack/test-integration.sh
-```
-
-### End-to-End tests
-
-You can run an end-to-end test which will bring up a master and two minions, perform some tests, and then tear everything down. Make sure you have followed the getting started steps for your chosen cloud platform (which might involve changing the `KUBERNETES_PROVIDER` environment variable to something other than "gce".
-```
-cd kubernetes
-hack/e2e-test.sh
-```
-
-Pressing control-C should result in an orderly shutdown but if something goes wrong and you still have some VMs running you can force a cleanup with the magical incantation:
-```
-hack/e2e-test.sh 1 1 1
-```
-
-### Testing out flaky tests
-[Instructions here](docs/flaky-tests.md)
-
-### Add/Update dependencies
-
-Kubernetes uses [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) to manage dependencies. To add or update a package, please follow the instructions on [godep's document](https://github.com/tools/godep).
-
-To add a new package ``foo/bar``:
-
-- Make sure the kubernetes' root directory is in $GOPATH/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes
-- Run ``godep restore`` to make sure you have all dependancies pulled.
-- Download foo/bar into the first directory in GOPATH: ``go get foo/bar``.
-- Change code in kubernetes to use ``foo/bar``.
-- Run ``godep save ./...`` under kubernetes' root directory.
-
-To update a package ``foo/bar``:
-
-- Make sure the kubernetes' root directory is in $GOPATH/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes
-- Run ``godep restore`` to make sure you have all dependancies pulled.
-- Update the package with ``go get -u foo/bar``.
-- Change code in kubernetes accordingly if necessary.
-- Run ``godep update foo/bar`` under kubernetes' root directory.
-
-### Keeping your development fork in sync
-
-One time after cloning your forked repo:
-
-```
-git remote add upstream https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes.git
-```
-
-Then each time you want to sync to upstream:
-
-```
-git fetch upstream
-git rebase upstream/master
-```
-
-### Regenerating the API documentation
-
-```
-cd kubernetes/api
-sudo docker build -t kubernetes/raml2html .
-sudo docker run --name="docgen" kubernetes/raml2html
-sudo docker cp docgen:/data/kubernetes.html .
-```
-
-View the API documentation using htmlpreview (works on your fork, too):
-```
-http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/api/kubernetes.html
-```

-## Getting started on Google Compute Engine
-
-### Prerequisites
-
-1. You need a Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled. Visit
-   [http://cloud.google.com/console](http://cloud.google.com/console) for more details.
-2. Make sure you can start up a GCE VM.  At least make sure you can do the [Create an instance](https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart#addvm) part of the GCE Quickstart.
-3. You need to have the Google Storage API, and the Google Storage JSON API enabled.
-4. You must have Go (version 1.2 or later) installed: [www.golang.org](http://www.golang.org).
-5. You must have the [`gcloud` components](https://developers.google.com/cloud/sdk/) installed.
-6. Ensure that your `gcloud` components are up-to-date by running `gcloud components update`.
-7. Get the Kubernetes source:
-
-        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes.git
-
-### Setup
-
-The setup script builds Kubernetes, then creates Google Compute Engine instances, firewall rules, and routes:
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-hack/dev-build-and-up.sh
-```
-
-The script above relies on Google Storage to deploy the software to instances running in GCE. It uses the Google Storage APIs so the "Google Cloud Storage JSON API" setting must be enabled for the project in the Google Developers Console (https://cloud.google.com/console#/project).
-
-The instances must also be able to connect to each other using their private IP. The script uses the "default" network which should have a firewall rule called "default-allow-internal" which allows traffic on any port on the private IPs.
-If this rule is missing from the default network or if you change the network being used in `cluster/config-default.sh` create a new rule with the following field values:
-* Source Ranges: 10.0.0.0/8
-* Allowed Protocols or Port: tcp:1-65535;udp:1-65535;icmp
-
-### Running a container (simple version)
-
-Once you have your instances up and running, the `build-go.sh` script sets up
-your Go workspace and builds the Go components.
-
-The `kubecfg.sh` script spins up two containers, running [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) and with port 80 mapped to 8080:
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-hack/build-go.sh
-cluster/kubecfg.sh -p 8080:80 run dockerfile/nginx 2 myNginx
-```
-
-To stop the containers:
-```
-cluster/kubecfg.sh stop myNginx
-```
-
-To delete the containers:
-```
-cluster/kubecfg.sh rm myNginx
-```
-
-### Running a container (more complete version)
-
-
-Assuming you've run `hack/dev-build-and-up.sh` and `hack/build-go.sh`:
-
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-cluster/kubecfg.sh -c api/examples/pod.json create /pods
-```
-
-Where pod.json contains something like:
-
-```
-{
-  "id": "php",
-  "kind": "Pod",
-  "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
-  "desiredState": {
-    "manifest": {
-      "version": "v1beta1",
-      "id": "php",
-      "containers": [{
-        "name": "nginx",
-        "image": "dockerfile/nginx",
-        "ports": [{
-          "containerPort": 80,
-          "hostPort": 8080
-        }],
-        "livenessProbe": {
-          "enabled": true,
-          "type": "http",
-          "initialDelaySeconds": 30,
-          "httpGet": {
-            "path": "/index.html",
-            "port": "8080"
-          }
-        }
-      }]
-    }
-  },
-  "labels": {
-    "name": "foo"
-  }
-}
-```
-
-Look in `api/examples/` for more examples
-
-### Tearing down the cluster
-```
-cd kubernetes
-cluster/kube-down.sh
-```
-
-## Getting started with a Vagrant cluster on your host
-
-### Prerequisites
-1. Install latest version >= 1.6.2 of vagrant from http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
-2. Install latest version of Virtual Box from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
-3. Get the Kubernetes source:
-
-```
-git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes.git
-```
-
-### Setup
-
-By default, the Vagrant setup will create a single kubernetes-master and 3 kubernetes-minions.  You can control the number of minions that are instantiated via an environment variable on your host machine.  If you plan to work with replicas, we strongly encourage you to work with enough minions to satisfy your largest intended replica size.  If you do not plan to work with replicas, you can save some system resources by running with a single minion.
-
-```
-export KUBERNETES_NUM_MINIONS=3
-```
-
-To start your local cluster, open a terminal window and run:
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-vagrant up
-```
-
-Vagrant will provision each machine in the cluster with all the necessary components to build and run Kubernetes.  The initial setup can take a few minutes to complete on each machine.
-
-By default, each VM in the cluster is running Fedora, and all of the Kubernetes services are installed into systemd.
-
-To access the master or any minion:
-
-```
-vagrant ssh master
-vagrant ssh minion-1
-vagrant ssh minion-2
-vagrant ssh minion-3
-```
-
-To view the service status and/or logs on the kubernetes-master:
-```
-vagrant ssh master
-[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~] $ sudo systemctl status apiserver
-[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~] $ sudo journalctl -r -u apiserver
-
-[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~] $ sudo systemctl status controller-manager
-[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~] $ sudo journalctl -r -u controller-manager
-
-[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~] $ sudo systemctl status etcd
-[vagrant@kubernetes-master ~] $ sudo systemctl status nginx
-```
-
-To view the services on any of the kubernetes-minion(s):
-```
-vagrant ssh minion-1
-[vagrant@kubernetes-minion-1] $ sudo systemctl status docker
-[vagrant@kubernetes-minion-1] $ sudo journalctl -r -u docker
-[vagrant@kubernetes-minion-1] $ sudo systemctl status kubelet
-[vagrant@kubernetes-minion-1] $ sudo journalctl -r -u kubelet
-```
-
-To push updates to new Kubernetes code after making source changes:
-```
-vagrant provision
-```
-
-To shutdown and then restart the cluster:
-```
-vagrant halt
-vagrant up
-```
-
-To destroy the cluster:
-```
-vagrant destroy -f
-```
-
-You can also use the cluster/kube-*.sh scripts to interact with vagrant based providers just like any other hosting platform for kubernetes.
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-modify cluster/kube-env.sh:
-  KUBERNETES_PROVIDER="vagrant"
-
-cluster/kube-up.sh => brings up a vagrant cluster
-cluster/kube-down.sh => destroys a vagrant cluster
-cluster/kube-push.sh => updates a vagrant cluster
-cluster/kubecfg.sh => interact with the cluster
-```
-
-
-### Running a container
-
-Your cluster is running, and you want to start running containers!
-
-You can now use any of the cluster/kube-*.sh commands to interact with your VM machines.
-```
-cluster/kubecfg.sh list /pods
-cluster/kubecfg.sh list /services
-cluster/kubecfg.sh list /replicationControllers
-cluster/kubecfg.sh -p 8080:80 run dockerfile/nginx 3 myNginx
-
-## begin wait for provision to complete, you can monitor the minions by doing
-  vagrant ssh minion-1
-  sudo docker images
-  ## you should see it pulling the dockerfile/nginx image, once the above command returns it
-  sudo docker ps
-  ## you should see your container running!
-  exit
-## end wait
-
-## back on the host, introspect kubernetes!
-cluster/kubecfg.sh list /pods
-cluster/kubecfg.sh list /services
-cluster/kubecfg.sh list /replicationControllers
-```
-
-Congratulations!
-
-### Testing
-
-The following will run all of the end-to-end testing scenarios assuming you set your environment in cluster/kube-env.sh
-
-```
-hack/e2e-test.sh
-```
-
-
-### Troubleshooting
-
-#### I just created the cluster, but I do not see my container running!
-
-If this is your first time creating the cluster, the kubelet on each minion schedules a number of docker pull requests to fetch prerequisite images.  This can take some time and as a result may delay your initial pod getting provisioned.
-
-#### I changed Kubernetes code, but its not running!
-
-Are you sure there was no build error?  After running $ vagrant provision, scroll up and ensure that each Salt state was completed successfully on each box in the cluster.  Its very likely you see a build error due to an error in your source files!
-
-## Running locally
-In a separate tab of your terminal, run:
-
-```
-cd kubernetes
-hack/local-up-cluster.sh
-```
-
-This will build and start a lightweight local cluster, consisting of a master and a single minion. Type Control-C to shut it down.
-
-If you are running both a remote kubernetes cluster and the local cluster, you can determine which you talk to using the ```KUBERNETES_MASTER``` environment variable.

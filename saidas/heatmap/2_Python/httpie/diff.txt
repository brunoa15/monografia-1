+Best practices
+--------------
+
+The default behaviour of automatically reading ``stdin`` is typically not
+desirable during non-interactive invocations. You most likely want
+use the ``--ignore-stdin`` option to disable it.
+
+It is a common gotcha that without this option HTTPie seemingly hangs.
+What happens is that when HTTPie is invoked for example from a cron job,
+``stdin`` is not connected to a terminal.
+Therefore, rules for `redirected input`_ apply, i.e., HTTPie starts to read it
+expecting that the request body will be passed through.
+And since there's no data nor ``EOF``, it will be stuck. So unless you're
+piping some data to HTTPie, this flag should be used in scripts.
+
+Also, it's might be good to override the default ``30`` second ``--timeout`` to
+something that suits you.

-    * Changed the default JSON ``Content-Type``
-      from ``application/json; charset=utf-8`` to ``application/json``
-      as UTF-8 is the default encoding for JSON.
-* `0.9.1`_ (2015-02-07)
-    * Added support for Requests transport adapter plugins
-      to enable plugin-provided features such as
-      `unix socket <https://github.com/msabramo/httpie-unixsocket>`_
-      communication and

-      the contents of text and JSON files into request data.
-    * Added curl-style shorthand for localhost.
-    * Fixed request ``Host`` header value output so that it doesn't contain
-      credentials, if included in the URL.
-* `0.7.1`_ (2013-09-24)
-    * Added ``--ignore-stdin``.
-    * Added support for auth plugins.

-      anymore as they are request-specific.

-    * Bugfixes.

-* `0.2.7`_ (2012-08-07)

-      removed, for usage use ``--help``).
-    * Form data and URL parameters can have multiple fields with the same name
-      (e.g.,``http -f url a=1 a=2``).
-    * Added ``--check-status`` to exit with an error on HTTP 3xx, 4xx and
-      5xx (3, 4, and 5, respectively).
-    * If the output is piped to another program or redirected to a file,
-      the default behaviour is to only print the response body.
-      (It can still be overwritten via the ``--print`` flag.)
-    * Improved highlighting of HTTP headers.
-    * Added query string parameters (``param==value``).
-    * Added support for terminal colors under Windows.
-* `0.2.5`_ (2012-07-17)
-    * Unicode characters in prettified JSON now don't get escaped for
-      improved readability.
-    * --auth now prompts for a password if only a username provided.
-    * Added support for request payloads from a file path with automatic
-      ``Content-Type`` (``http URL @/path``).

-    * Fixed Content-Type for requests with no data.
-* `0.2.2`_ (2012-06-24)
-    * The ``METHOD`` positional argument can now be omitted (defaults to

-* `0.2.1`_ (2012-06-13)
-    * Added compatibility with ``requests-0.12.1``.
-    * Dropped custom JSON and HTTP lexers in favor of the ones newly included
-      in ``pygments-1.5``.
-* `0.2.0`_ (2012-04-25)
-    * Added Python 3 support.
-    * Added the ability to print the HTTP request as well as the response
-      (see ``--print`` and ``--verbose``).

+If not provided via ``--output, -o``, the output filename will be determined
+from ``Content-Disposition`` (if available), or from the URL and

+suffix to it.

+You can also redirect the response body to another program while the response
+headers and progress are still shown in the terminal:

+
+If ``--output, -o`` is specified, you can resume a partial download using the
+``--continue, -c`` option. This only works with servers that support
+``Range`` requests and ``206 Partial Content`` responses. If the server doesn't
+support that, the whole file will simply be downloaded:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+

+Other notes:
+
+* The ``--download`` option only changes how the response body is treated.
+* You can still set custom headers, use ``--verbose, -v``, etc.
+* ``--download`` always implies ``--follow`` (redirects are followed).
+* HTTPie exists with status code ``1`` (error) if the body hasn't been fully
+  downloaded.
+* ``Accept-Encoding`` cannot be set with ``--download``.

+===========
+Request URL
+===========
+
+The only information HTTPie needs to perform a request is a URL.
+The default scheme is, somewhat unsurprisingly, ``http://``,
+and can be omitted from the argument – ``http example.org`` works just fine.
+
+If find yourself manually constructing URLs with **querystring parameters**
+on the terminal, you may appreciate the ``param==value`` syntax for appending
+URL parameters so that you don't have to worry about escaping the ``&``
+separators. To search for ``HTTPie`` on Google Images you could use this
+command:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http GET www.google.com search==HTTPie tbm==isch

+
+=============
+Request Items
+=============
+
+There are five different *request item* types that provide a
+convenient mechanism for specifying HTTP headers, simple JSON and
+form data, files, and URL parameters.
+
+They are key/value pairs specified after the URL. All have in
+common that they become part of the actual request that is sent and that
+their type is distinguished only by the separator used:
+``:``, ``=``, ``:=``, ``@``, and ``==``.
+

+By default, HTTPie outputs the whole response message (headers as well as the
+body).
+
+You can control what should be printed via several options:
+
+=================   =====================================================
+``--headers, -h``   Only the response headers are printed.
+``--body, -b``      Only the response body is printed.
+``--verbose, -v``   Print the whole HTTP exchange (request and response).
+``--print, -p``     Selects parts of the HTTP exchange.
+=================   =====================================================
+
+``--verbose`` can often be useful for debugging the request and generating
+documentation examples:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http --verbose PUT httpbin.org/put hello=world
+    PUT /put HTTP/1.1
+    Accept: application/json
+    Accept-Encoding: identity, deflate, compress, gzip
+    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
+    Host: httpbin.org
+    User-Agent: HTTPie/0.2.7dev
+
+    {
+        "hello": "world"
+    }
+

+    Server: gunicorn/0.13.4
+
+    {
+        […]
+    }
+
+
+All the other options are just a shortcut for ``--print`` / ``-p``.
+It accepts a string of characters each of which represents a specific part of
+the HTTP exchange:
+
+==========  ==================
+Character   Stands for
+==========  ==================
+``H``       Request headers.
+``B``       Request body.
+``h``       Response headers.
+``b``       Response body.
+==========  ==================
+
+Print both the request and response headers:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http --print=Hh PUT httpbin.org/put hello=world
+
+
+-------------------------
+Conditional Body Download
+-------------------------
+
+As an optimization, the response body is downloaded from the server
+only if it's part of the output. This is similar to performing a ``HEAD``
+request, except that it applies to any HTTP method you use.
+
+Let's say that there is an API that returns the whole resource when it is
+updated, but you are only interested in the response headers to see the
+status code after the update:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http --headers PATCH example.org/Really-Huge-Resource name='New Name'
+
+
+Since we are only printing the HTTP headers here, the connection to server
+is closed as soon as all the response headers have been received.
+Therefore, bandwidth and time isn't wasted downloading the body
+which you don't care about.
+
+The response headers are downloaded always, even if they are not part of
+the output
+
+
+================
+Redirected Input
+================
+
+**A universal method for passing request data is through redirected** ``stdin``
+(standard input). Such data is buffered and then with no further processing
+used as the request body. There are multiple useful ways to use piping:
+
+Redirect from a file:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http PUT example.com/person/1 X-API-Token:123 < person.json
+
+
+Or the output of another program:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ grep /var/log/httpd/error_log '401 Unauthorized' | http POST example.org/intruders
+
+
+You can use ``echo`` for simple data:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ echo '{"name": "John"}' | http PATCH example.com/person/1 X-API-Token:123
+
+
+You can even pipe web services together using HTTPie:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http GET https://api.github.com/repos/jkbr/httpie | http POST httpbin.org/post
+
+
+You can use ``cat`` to enter multiline data on the terminal:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ cat | http POST example.com⏎
+    <paste>
+    ^D
+
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ cat | http POST example.com/todos Content-Type:text/plain⏎
+    - buy milk
+    - call parents
+    ^D
+
+
+On OS X, you can send the contents of the clipboard with ``pbpaste``:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ pbpaste | http PUT example.com
+
+
+Passing data through ``stdin`` cannot be combined with data fields specified
+on the command line.
+
+
+-------------------------
+Body Data From a Filename
+-------------------------
+
+**An alternative to redirected** ``stdin`` is specifying a filename (as
+``@/path/to/file``) whose content is used as if it came from ``stdin``.
+
+It has the advantage that **the** ``Content-Type``
+**header will automatically be set** to the appropriate value based on the
+filename extension. For example, the following request sends the
+verbatim contents of that XML file with ``Content-Type: application/xml``:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http PUT httpbin.org/put @/data/file.xml
+
+
+=================
+Terminal Output
+=================
+
+HTTPie does several things by default to make its terminal output easy to read.
+
+
+---------------------
+Colors and Formatting
+---------------------
+
+Syntax highlighting is applied to HTTP headers and bodies (where it makes
+sense). Also, the following formatting is used:
+
+* HTTP headers are sorted by name.
+* JSON data is indented, sorted by keys, and unicode escapes are converted
+  to the characters they represent.
+
+Colorizing and formatting can be disabled with ``--ugly, -u``.
+
+
+-----------
+Binary data
+-----------
+
+Binary data is suppressed for terminal output, which makes it safe to perform
+requests to URLs send back binary data. Binary data is suppressed also in
+redirected, but prettified output. The connection is closed as soon as we know
+that the response body is binary,
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    http example.org/File.mov
+
+
+You will immediately see something like this:
+
+.. code-block:: http
+
+    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
+    Accept-Ranges: bytes
+    Content-Encoding: gzip
+    Content-Type: video/quicktime
+    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
+
+    +-----------------------------------------+
+    | NOTE: binary data not shown in terminal |
+    +-----------------------------------------+
+
+
+=================
+Redirected Output
+=================
+
+HTTPie uses **different defaults** for redirected output than for
+`terminal output`_:
+
+* Formatting and colors aren't applied (unless ``--pretty`` is set).
+* Only the response body is printed (unless one of the `output options`_ is set).
+* Also, binary data isn't suppressed.
+
+The reason is to make piping HTTPie's output to another programs and
+downloading files work with no extra flags. Most of the time, only the raw
+response body is of an interest when the output is redirected.
+
+Download a file:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http example.org/Movie.mov > Movie.mov
+
+
+Download an image of Octocat, resize it using ImageMagick, upload it elsewhere:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http octodex.github.com/images/original.jpg | convert - -resize 25% -  | http example.org/Octocats
+
+
+Force colorizing and formatting, and show both the request and response in
+``less`` pager:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http --pretty --verbose example.org | less -R
+
+
+==================
+Streamed Responses
+==================
+
+Responses are downloaded and printed in chunks, which allows for streaming
+and large file downloads without using too much RAM. However, when
+`colors and formatting`_ are applied, the whole response is buffered and only
+then processed at once.
+
+
+You can use the ``--stream, -S`` flag to make two things happen:
+
+1. The output is flushed in **much smaller chunks** without any buffering,
+   which makes HTTPie behave kind of like ``tail -f`` for URLs.
+
+2. Streaming becomes enabled even when the output is prettified: It will be
+   applied to **each line** of the response and flushed immediately. This makes
+   it possible to have a nice output of long-lived requests, such as one
+   to the Twitter streaming API.
+
+
+Prettified streamed response:
+
+.. code-block:: bash
+
+    $ http --stream -f -a YOUR-TWITTER-NAME https://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/filter.json track='Justin Bieber'
+

+    # server as soon as it arrives from the Twitter streaming API:

-                            to also check the HTTP status code and exit with an
-                            error if the status indicates one. When the server
-                            replies with a 4xx (Client Error) or 5xx (Server
-                            Error) status code, HTTPie exits with 4 or 5
-                            respectively. If the response is a 3xx (Redirect) and
-                            --allow-redirects hasn't been set, then the exit
-                            status is 3. Also an error message is written to

-      --auth AUTH, -a AUTH  username:password. If only the username is provided

-There are five types of key-value pair items available:
-
-Headers (``Name:Value``)
-   Arbitrary HTTP headers. The ``:`` character is used to separate a header's
-   name from its value, e.g., ``X-API-Token:123``.
-
-Simple data fields (``field=value``)
-  Data items are included in the request body. Depending on the
-  ``Content-Type``, they are automatically serialized as a JSON ``Object``
-  (default) or ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded`` (the ``-f`` flag).
-  Data items use ``=`` as the separator, e.g., ``hello=world``.
-
-Raw JSON fields (``field:=value``)
-  This item type is needed when ``Content-Type`` is JSON and a field's value
-  is a ``Boolean``, ``Number``,  nested ``Object`` or an ``Array``, because
-  simple data items are always serialized as ``String``.
-  E.g. ``pies:=[1,2,3]``, or ``'meals=["ham", "spam"]'`` (mind the quotes).
-
-File fields (``field@/path/to/file``)
-  Only available with ``-f`` / ``--form``. Use ``@`` as the separator, e.g.,
-  ``screenshot@/path/to/file.png``. The presence of a file field results into
-  a ``multipart/form-data`` request.
-
-Query string parameters (``name==value``)
-  Appends the given name/value pair as a query string parameter to the URL.

-Dependencies

-- NumPy
-- Cython (Optional)
-- CUDA (Optional)

-
-## Option 1: pure python only
-
-No compilation is required for this option, and NumPy is the only dependency.
-Just update your `PYTHONPATH` as follows:
-
-    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/cgt
-
-## Option 2: build C++ backend
-
-If you want to use the C++ backend, which has better performance and in the future will allow multithreading, then Cython is required, and the installation procedure is as follows.
-First, `cd` into the source directory. Then, type
-
-    mkdir build
-    cd build
-    cmake ..
-    make -j
-
-Then add two directories to your `PYTHONPATH`
-
-    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/cgt:/path/to/cgt/build/lib:$PYTHONPATH

-
-Note: if you don't want to put the `build` directory inside your source directory, you can put it in some other location, just make sure to alter alter your `PYTHONPATH` accordingly.
-
-## Option 3: build C++ backend with CUDA
-
-Follow the instructons for Option 2, but alter the cmake command to instead read

-In source directory,

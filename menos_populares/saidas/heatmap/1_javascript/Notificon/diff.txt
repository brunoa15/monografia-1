+# Notificon :: _Client-side favicon notifications._
+Notificon is a BSD licensed javascript class for providing client-side favicon notifications.
+Instead of requiring a number of favicons be created and served up to the client, you can specify a label and a favicon (default being the current favicon) and it will generate a favicon notification.
+
+## Basic Usage
+1) Include the notificon.js in your page
+2) Call Notificon(12) to overlay the number 12 on your favicon.
+
+## Advance Usage
+Notificon can take 2 parameters - Notificon(label, favicon_url) where label is the text to overlay, and favicon_url is the url of a 16x16 favicon.
+
+An empty label will clear your favicon to its original state. e.g. Notificon();
+
+Favicon_url defaults to your primary favicon (if specified in head, or with fallback to /favicon.ico)

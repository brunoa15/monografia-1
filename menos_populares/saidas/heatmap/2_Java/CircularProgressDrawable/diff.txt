+
+Why a drawable?
+---------------
+
+If you want to achieve interesting effects and animations on Android, a surprisingly easy and fast
+way to achieve it is subclassing a Drawable instead of subclassing a Button or an ImageView.
+
+In order to implement advanced behavior over the Drawable, you can still implement your own animations
+by using Android animations framework or by the use of listeners on the views you are using.

+
+Composition
+-----------
+
+The Circular Progress Drawable is made out of three differentiated components:
+
+* The first one is what is known as the *inner circle*. The inner circle takes up to 3/4 of the radius
+of the drawable and can be scaled up and down to achieve a progress effect or to serve a background
+for a TextView on top to indicate its meaning. 
+* The next is the *outline ring*. This ring will surround the inner circle and it is intended as
+ a subtle cue of the empty state of the progress.
+* The last is the *outer ring*. It will be used for several purposes. The first is to show the progress
+of the drawable. In the current version, the progress ring is filled from the bottom and counter-clockwise.
+
+Usage
+-----
+Circular Progress Drawable can be defined programatically and the only parameters it will require
+will be the different colours and the size of the outer ring.
+
+Scale Property for the inner ring can be used to achieve a variety of effects, as pulsating effects, overshoot
+or to make it disappear completely.
+
+The drawable allows both for a progress and an indetermination mode. In the indetermination mode
+instead of filling the outer ring, a 90ยบ arc will be shown that can be animated to spin around the
+inner circle.

+
+Tips
+----
+
+* Take advantage of the Android Animators to achieve a variety of effects around Circular Progress Drawable.
+* If you want more interesting feedback you can use *onTouchListeners* over your View. 
+* Have a look at the sample for some ideas.
+
+Proguard
+--------
+
+If you rely on Animators for animation and your application is obfuscated using Proguard, be advised
+that your Circular Progress Drawable animations could stop working. In order to avoid that add
+`-keepclassmembers class com.sefford.circularprogressdrawable.CircularProgressDrawable { *;}`
+to your proguard.conf file.
